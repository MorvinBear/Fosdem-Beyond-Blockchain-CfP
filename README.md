* Inspiring multimedia arty experience for devs to “get” the distributed web 
* Whatever would be appropriate for sharing with open-source devs that fits in the Beyond Blockchain category that is this category, which is, the Beyond Blockchain category

### Talk details
* The default durations for talk recordings are 10/20/30 minutes 
* Please select the most suitable duration for your talk, excluding Q&A
* Sessions will be 45 minutes with Q/A on average, and we strongly encourage shorter, more potent presentations with more time for interactive Q/A
* If you have a brief talk, we can fit it into a lightning talk session!

### For accepted talks
* Once your talk is accepted, we will assign you an organizer to help you to produce the pre-recorded content.
* The organizer will review the content and ensure it has the required quality. They are responsible to ensure the content is into the system and ready to broadcast.
* During the stream of your talk, you must be available online for the Q/A sessions

### Submit your talk!
* All submissions for devrooms are made through the [FOSDEM Pentabarf website](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM21) - you need to register, in case you haven't done so already.
* Select the "Beyond Blockchain devroom" as the track for your "event", which is FOSDEMspeak for talk.
* Add all the info requested and whatever you think it's necessary for us to select it for FOSDEM.
* Please remember to include your time zone in your bio or where you think it's reasonable so that we can schedule your talk accordingly.

### We need volunteers!
If you want to help with helping speakers setup and record their talks, facilitating during the event, getting the word out to more projects, mailing sweet letters with watercolors of flowers to organizers and presenters and other volunteers, and/or some other thing, please let us know!
